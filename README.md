The Face Detection Using Streamlit project aims to develop a web application that can detect faces in images and videos in real-time. By leveraging OpenCV for image processing and Streamlit for creating interactive web interfaces, this project provides an accessible tool for face detection that can be used in various applications such as security systems, photo tagging, and attendance tracking.
